Lazy Bob really really really loves trucks, so he decides to start designing toys so that kids all over the world can have the joy of playing with toy trucks.

Every toy truck produced by Lazy Bob's toy factory has a positive integer length, L
 (1≤L≤100
), given in inches. Lazy Bob wants you to help him figure out, for a given toy truck, if it can fit in a toy box or not. A truck can only fit in a toy box if its length is less than or equal to 10
 inches. Please help Bob accomplish this task. If the toy truck is an appropriate size, print "YES" (without quotes), otherwise print "NO" (without quotes).

Input
Line 1: One integer, L
 (1≤L≤100
).

Output
Line 1: Either "YES" (without quotes), if the truck's length is ≤ 10
 inches, otherwise "NO" (without quotes).
